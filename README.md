# TikTok-API
An API that allows you to get full information about TikTok videos without using any third party sources and only the TikTok API.

##API only allows to gather data, and not to bot an account.##

This is a small project of mine and was made public to help others, feel free to fork this project and make a better documentation/api.

# More

This API requires the requests lib https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/

# Usage
